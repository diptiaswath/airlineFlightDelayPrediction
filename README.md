## Executive Summary

### Problem Statement:

Airlines and airports face significant operational challenges due to flight delays, which can be caused by a variety of factors including flight status, weather conditions, air traffic congestion, aircraft specifics, and inefficiencies in ground and passenger handling. The objective is to predict flight delays by developing a multi-class classification model that considers both departure and arrival delays, helping improve operational planning and customer satisfaction.

### Rationale:

Flight delays can have widespread consequences for airlines, from passenger dissatisfaction to operational disruptions. Developing a predictive model for flight delays not only addresses the core issue of minimizing delays but also enhances decision-making processes across various facets of airline operations.

#### Business Case 1: Enhancing Operational Efficiency

Predicting flight delays enables airlines to optimize their operations, routing, and resource management.

-   **Route Optimization and Scheduling Adjustments**: Airlines can reroute flights to avoid congested airspace or adverse weather, minimizing delays. Predictions also allow real-time adjustments to schedules, gates, and crew to manage disruptions efficiently.

-   **Resource Allocation**: By anticipating delays, airlines can proactively allocate ground crew, gates, and equipment, reducing the cascading effects on other flights.

-   **Operational Resilience**: Dynamic rerouting and resource realignment minimize the operational impacts of weather or high-traffic delays, enhancing resilience in crisis situations.

-   **Cost Management**: Avoiding delays lowers costs linked to operational disruptions, improving resource utilization and overall profitability.

#### Business Case 2: Improving Customer Experience

Accurate delay predictions lead to better customer service and proactive communication, enhancing the passenger experience.

-   **Proactive Passenger Communication**: Accurate predictions allow airlines to update passengers promptly, manage expectations, and offer rebooking or compensation options.

-   **Improved Customer Service**: Delay forecasts support better service recovery, leading to a smoother passenger experience and increased loyalty.

-   **Competitive Advantage**: Effective rerouting and communication give airlines an edge in maintaining on-time performance and customer satisfaction.

By addressing these areas, airlines can significantly improve operational efficiency, enhance passenger experience with better customer satisfaction scores, and better manage resources and disruptions. Predictive modeling for flight delays is not just about minimizing delays but also about fostering a more responsive and resilient airline operation.

#### Example Usage: An AI system that predicts flight delays could also:

1.  Suggest alternate flight paths that are less likely to experience delays.

2.  Provide passengers with timely updates and rebooking options.

3.  Dynamically adjust flight schedules to manage disruptions effectively.

4.  Allocate resources efficiently to minimize the impact on subsequent flights.

### Research Question:

How can a multi-class classification model be developed to accurately predict flight delays by assessing multiple factors, including departure and arrival delays, using data related to flight status, weather conditions, air traffic, aircraft specifics, and ground operations?

### Evaluation Criteria:

For predicting flight delays as a multi-class classification problem with:

-   **Class 0**: On-time flights

-   **Class 1**: Either the departure or arrival of the current flight is delayed

-   **Class 2**: Both departure and arrival of the current flight are delayed

The key criteria and metrics considered are:

1.  **Accurately predict delays while maintaining the accuracy of on-time flight predictions.**

2.  **Strike a balance between:**

    -   **High recall for delays**: Ensuring delayed flights are correctly identified.

    -   **High precision for delays**: Avoiding misclassification of on-time flights as delayed.

To monitor **overall model performance**, we use **Precision-Recall Area Under the Curve (PR AUC)** and **Receiver Operating Characteristic Area Under the Curve (ROC AUC)**. For evaluating the balance between recall and precision, we rely on the **F1 Score** as the primary metric.

### Approach:

#### CRISP-DM Framework:

For the Flight Delay Prediction problem, the CRISP-DM (Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) framework was applied to provide a structured solution. The process was as follows:

1.  **Business Understanding:** The goal was to predict flight delays to improve airline operational efficiency and enhance customer satisfaction by reducing unexpected delays.

2.  **Data Understanding:** A detailed analysis of the dataset was performed, identifying key patterns and relationships, such as flight times, delays, and distances, that could significantly influence prediction outcomes.

3.  **Data Preparation:** The raw data was preprocessed, and relevant features were engineered. This included detailed delay metrics such as departure and arrival times, distances, and other flight-specific attributes to ensure high-quality inputs for model training.

4.  **Modeling:** Various machine learning models were trained and evaluated, focusing on performance metrics like Precision-Recall AUC, ROC AUC, and F1 score. These models were iteratively tuned to optimize predictive performance.

5.  **Deployment:** The best-performing model was integrated into **SkyFlowâ€™s** prototype application, enabling real-time flight delay predictions. Future iterations aim to further enhance operational decision-making.

#### Feature Engineering Approach: 

During the data preparation phase, significant feature engineering was conducted as outlined in a later Methodology section. Initially, features that captured the relationship between departure and arrival delays were found to introduce data leakage, leading to overly optimistic predictions. As a result, these features were excluded in Phase 2.

To improve model performance in Phase2, new features were engineered by tracking flight segment sequences for each tail number on a given day (e.g., SEGMENT_NUMBER). **Historical flight information**, such as previous airports (PREVIOUS_AIRPORT), prior delays (PREVIOUS_ARR_DELAY), and flight durations (PREVIOUS_DURATION), was incorporated. This was done by merging **current flight records** with its own FLIGHT_DURATION with the corresponding previous segment data, providing a richer and more comprehensive dataset for predicting delays.

**Delay Trends Across Distance Groups and Flight Segments (2019):** This finding helps provide valuable insights into how aircraft operational schedules and the number of daily flights contributed to 2019 delays, effectively addressing **operational efficiency and contingency planning**. Understanding how delay patterns vary with flight distance and segment numbers helps airlines plan better turnaround times and manage operational schedules more effectively to prevent delays.

-   **Segment Number Decreases with Distance**: As flight distance increases, the number of segments (flights) decreases. Aircraft flying longer routes complete fewer flights in a day due to time constraints.

-   **Delays Correlate with Higher Segment Numbers**: Flights scheduled for more segments in a day are more prone to delays, regardless of distance. These delays are likely due to operational factors, such as shorter turnaround times, leading to delayed departures and arrivals.

**Median Departure and Arrival Delays per Carrier (2019):** Identified the top 20 carriers with the highest median delays. For each carrier, the top 20 airports with the most significant contribution to delays were also identified. By examining median delays, airlines can gain insights into typical delay experiences and ensure compliance with regulations. Focusing on specific carriers and airports with high delays can enhance **overall safety and customer satisfaction**.

-   **Comprehensive Delay Analysis:** By considering both departure and arrival delays, we provide a more holistic view of 2019 airline performance and airport efficiency. Endeavor Air Inc shows a highest delay at Miami International Airport. Comair Inc follows with the next highest delay at Portland International Airport.

-   **Focus on median delays**: The use of median delays helped identify typical delay experiences, filtering out the effect of extreme delays that skewed averages.

-   **Unique Operational Factors:** The variation in delay trends suggests that delays may be influenced by distinct factors specific to each carrier and airport, rather than being caused by common issues across multiple locations. For instance, both Endeavor Air Inc and Comair Inc experienced higher-than-usual precipitation at the airports on their flight day, which could have contributed to their delays.

-   Good accuracy (0.8234)

-   High weighted PR AUC (0.82)

-   High weighted ROC AUC (0.80)

**Key strengths:**

-   Performance comparable to the Voting Classifier

-   Good balance between precision and recall for delay classes 0 and 2

**Deployment considerations:**

-   Use as a complementary model to the Voting Classifier

-   Use where compute resources and infrastructure allow for multiple model deployments

### Features influencing model recommendation:

Based on the feature importance results from across these models, the following features are consistently influential in flight delay predictions â€“ ref: [feature descriptions](https://media.githubusercontent.com/media/diptiaswath/airlineFlightDelayPrediction/refs/heads/main/combined_data/dataset_documentation_v2.txt):

-   PREVIOUS_ARR_DELAY: This is consistently the most important feature across all models. It represents the arrival delay of the previous flight for the same aircraft.

-   SEGMENT_NUMBER: This feature, which represents the order of flights for an aircraft on a given day, is highly influential in several models.

-   PREVIOUS_DURATION: The duration of the previous flight is an important factor in predicting delays.

-   DEP_PART_OF_DAY: The time of day when the current flight departs is a significant predictor of delays.

-   PREVIOUS_AIRPORT: The departing airport from where the aircraft on its previous segment last came seems to have a notable impact on delay predictions.

-   DISTANCE: The flight distance appears to be moderately important in several models.

-   DEP_BLOCK_HIST: Historical average delay for different departure time blocks is influential.

-   CARRIER_NAME: The airline operating the flight is a relevant factor in some models.

-   PRCP: Precipitation at the airport on the day of the flight is a notable weather-related feature.

-   DAY_OF_WEEK: The day of the week when the flight occurs has some influence on delay predictions.

These features consistently appear among the top influential factors across different models (Bagging Classifier, Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, and ensemble methods like Voting and Stacking Classifiers). While the exact order and magnitude of importance varies between the models, these features represent a mix of temporal factors (previous delays and time of day), operational aspects (segment number and carrier), geographical elements (distance and previous airport), and weather conditions (precipitation).

## Methodology Used for Data Preparation and Modeling

**Data Preparation:** Involved cleaning and merging multiple raw CSV files to create a unified dataset with \~4M entries (for training) and \~2M entries (for testing) with 34 predictor variables and 1 target variable. Raw data-set description is [here](https://github.com/diptiaswath/airlineFlightDelayPrediction/blob/main/raw_data/raw_data_documentation.txt).

**Feature Engineering:**

-   **Delay Categories:** Classified delays into three distinct categories for more granular analysis of flight performance:

    Class0: On-time Departure and Arrival - Flights that depart and arrive within their scheduled times.

    Class1: Either departure or arrival delayed - Flights that experience delays either during arrival or departure.

    Class2: Delayed Departure and Arrival - Flights that experience delays both in departure and arrival times.![A close up of a document Description automatically generated](images/4179d2a6da699c4916a9146148ebaa37.jpeg)

    ![A comparison of a number of classes Description automatically generated](images/8d8b75635e1f4f86ef2204ecb997fd7b.jpeg)

-   **Aggregation Features:** Developed historical delay averages, to identify patterns and trends in airline operations.

```
    CARRIER_HISTORICAL = captures the historical average delay rate of each carrier per month

    DEP_AIRPORT_HIST = captures historical average delay rates for flights departing from specific airports per month

    PREV_AIRPORT_HIST = captures historical average delay rate for the airport from which the aircraft arrived before the current departure

    DAY_HISTORICAL = captures historical average delays associated with each day of the week, adjusted monthly

    DEP_BLOCK_HIST = captures historical average delay rate for different departure time blocks, aggregated by month
```

-   **Time-Based Features:** Extracted seasonal information from the month and categorized parts of the day using departure and arrival time blocks to enhance temporal analysis of flight data.

    ![A group of bars with numbers Description automatically generated with medium confidence](images/109e7b83d38d2bfe4e13dd5c67060ea6.jpeg)

-   **Distance-Based Features:** Mapped distance groups to descriptive labels, providing clearer insights into flight range categories for more intuitive analysis.

    ![A close-up of a graph Description automatically generated](images/30988bff062a1543f4a633070acbba1f.jpeg)

-   **Delay-Based Features:** Created new features by combining actual departure and arrival times with scheduled times, generating detailed delay metrics to enhance analysis of flight performance and punctuality. However, in Phase 2 of model evaluation, these features were removed due to data leakage, as they resulted in nearly 100% prediction accuracy.

```
    ELAPSED_TIME_DIFF, DEP_DELAY, ARR_DELAY
```

-   **Flight Duration, Previous Flight Duration and Arrival Delay:** Phase2 also introduced new delay-based features. Flight duration was the total duration of the current flight calculated from the planned departure and arrival times. This feature helps in assessing how longer flight durations may correlate with increased delays. Previous Flight Duration and Previous Arrival Delay were introduced as historical features and the approach to engineering these new features is outlined in the executive summary.

![A chart of flight duration Description automatically generated with medium confidence](images/6b46969dc7c96afd406a9c57597f1a32.jpeg)

```
    FLIGHT_DURATION, FLIGHT_DURATION_CATEGORY, PREVIOUS_DURATION, 
    PREVIOUS_DURATION_CATEGORY, PREVIOUS_ARR_DELAY
```

-   **Employee Statistics Features:** Developed features to analyze staffing and resourcing in airline and carrier operations, providing insights into workforce allocation, scheduling efficiency, and resource optimization.

```
    FLT_ATTENDANTS_PER_PASS, PASSENGER_HANDLING
```

-   **Removed highly correlated** features with VIF â€“ see before and after removal:

**Data Pre-Processing:** Missing values and outliers detected were removed. SMOTE Tomek was applied to just the training dataset. This combined SMOTE's oversampling of the minority classes (classes 0,1 and 2) and Tomek links' under-sampling. Categorical features were also target encoded and Numerical features were scaled.

**Model Evaluation with Training, Validation and Test dataset:**

The dataset was initially split into Training (70%, 4.542M entries) and Test (30%, 1.946M entries) sets. The training set was further divided, with 20% retained for validation. From the remaining training data, a sample of up to 500,000 entries was extracted for model training, ensuring that the sample size did not exceed the available data.

All splits were performed using stratified sampling to maintain class distribution. This approach was adopted to manage the large dataset by creating a more manageable training set size while still preserving a substantial validation set.

## Key Insights from Phase1 to Phase2 of Project

-   Switched to predicting three classes instead of earlier four classes removing granularity of whether a flight had a specific arrival delay or a departure delay

-   Experimented with F2 scores as an evaluation metric

-   Switched back to focus on F1 Score to: a) Decrease false positives for delayed flights, especially Class 2, b) Improve accuracy of on-time flight predictions - Class1, c) Increase precision for Class 2 and Class 1

-   Revisited SMOTETomek sampling strategy to improve prediction performance for minority classes â€“ Class1 (either departure or arrival delayed) and Class2 â€“ (both arrival and departure delayed)

-  Adding a Stacking Classifier and a Hybrid Ensemble to improve F1 scores by combining the strengths of multiple models, allowing them to capture diverse patterns in the data. This approach helped achieve a better balance between precision and recall, improving overall F1 performance

-   Enhanced feature engineering outlined in summary to further improve model performance on minority class predictions

## Future Work

**Feature Engineering:** Improve flight prediction performance of the minority classes (Class1 and Class2) with engineered features.

**Extend Forecast Horizon:** Increase the prediction timeframe beyond the current 24-hour forecast, potentially providing predictions 48 or 72 hours in advance.

**Explore Artificial Neural Network models:** Investigate if performance can be improved further.

**Use of Principal Component Analysis (PCA):** With 2D visualization to explore patterns within the current delay classes. If analysis reveals significant overlap between classes or a lack of distinct patterns, it may be beneficial to consider a more granular classification, such as separating arrival delays and departure delays into their own distinct classes.

**Expand SkyFlow:** Refine its StreamLit interface beyond the initial prototype to include dashboards and to work with reduced number of inputs.

**Real-time Updates:** Incorporate real-time data to refine predictions as the departure time approaches.
